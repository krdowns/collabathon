# Hiking Meetup

# Objective
For this project, we were tasked with pairing up with designers and in just over 24 hours, developing a front-end for a mailing list for a hiking meetup app. I worked with one other developer as well. While I built the main layout of the site, he built the form and we combined the two together before presenting.

# Challenges
The timeline for this project as well as working with three others with differing points of view was the biggest challenge. Our designers however, made the process very simple with their detailed mockups and redlines. The experience of collaborating under a tight deadline was a great example of the problems we might face in the day-to-day life of a developer and helped me understand how to better communicate and work with designers.
